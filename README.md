# Sagely

_Purpose_: Use OSM vector data to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in AWS Sagemaker for building, road, (etc) object detection.

_Inputs_: Location of HOT-OSM task OR city/state/country of interest & a web-url to DG Cloud Optimized Geotif (COG).

_Outputs_: TMS (slippy map) training data using the OSM vectors + AWS Sagemaker model endpoint.

_Example Output_:

## Notes

Your OSM vector data may be messy, and or may not align with the imagery. It is up to you to manually inspect, modify, cull the training data generated for optimal model performance. There is no step presented here to do this for you. In fact, it is a critical step as a Data Scientist that you own that element.
